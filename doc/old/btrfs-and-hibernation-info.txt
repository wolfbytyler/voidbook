btrfs and hibernation info

# check btrfs fs for consistency - recalculate checksums and compare if they are still the same
btrfs scrub start /dev/btrfs-device
btrfs scrub status /dev/btrfs-device

# hibernate, i.e. suspend to disk with encrypted rootfs and swapfile (btrfs and ext4)

# kernel options required:
# CONFIG_HIBERNATE_CALLBACKS=y
# CONFIG_HIBERNATION=y
# CONFIG_PM_STD_PARTITION=""

# the first line (polkit) seem to be not required on debian, but ubuntu seems to need it
# see files subdir for file content
vi /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/systemd-hibernate.service.d
vi /etc/systemd/system/systemd-hibernate.service.d/override.conf
systemctl daemon-reload

# see files subdir for btrfs_map_physical source and info
btrfs_map_physical /swap/file
# the last value of the first line (first physical offset of the swap file) is what we want
# divide result by page size (getconf PAGESIZE) = 4096
# for ext4: filefrag -v /swapfile | awk '{ if($1=="0:"){print substr($4, 1, length($4)-2)} }'
# in this case no further division is required

# grub or uboot params: resume=/dev/mapper/encrypted resume_offset=<divided number from above>
# note: make sure that there is no "noresume" still in the kernel cmdline
# /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume:
RESUME=/dev/mapper/encrypted
RESUME_OFFSET=<divided number from above>

# hibernate via: logout menu in xfce or systemctl hibernate
